Marketing Research Team:
* As the marketing research team, we want to do a market analysis on proposed BusMall products to test our potential customer interest before manufacturing our catalogs. To determine interest, we want to use an app that displays potential BusMall products to individual focus groups.
* As the marketing research team, we want the app to display three BusMall products at a time, side-by-side-by-side, and have the user select which product they are most likely to purchase.
* As the marketing research team, we want the data for the chosen products stored, calculated, and displayed visually in a bar chart.
* As the marketing research team, we want to keep the product selection process as untainted as possible by keeping the results hidden from the focus-group member until 15 selections are made.
* As the marketing research team, we want a button to appear after 15 clicks that give the focus-group member the option to see the results.
* As the marketing research team, we want a custom look and feel for our app.

* As a developer, I want to implement a constructor function, so that I can reuse code and eliminate much of the duplication in my JavaScript.

* As a developer, I want the app to display 3 randomized BusMall product images that change on click.
* As a developer, I want to make it so that the same product image does not appear more than once in the same grouping of 3 randomized images.
* As a developer, I want to be sure every product image appears at least once.
* As a developer, I want to build a button that appears after the focus-group member makes 15 clicks that gives the member the option to view the market analysis results.
* As a developer, I want to display the product click data in a bar chart using Chart.js.
* As a developer, I want to store the data using local storage.
* As a developer, I want to use CSS to implement a custom font and color pallet, and to create a layout with semantic HTML using Skeleton.
* As a developer, I want the app to have all the pertinent instructions and labels for the focus-group members and for the app to be optimized for mobile devices.
