BusMall Project

This project is a market research app for the fictional company BusMall.
BusMall specializes in items you can purchase while in transit on a metro bus.
The market analysis is to determine which of 15 potential BusMall products a user is most likely to purchase, so that BusMall can refine their product catalog.
The market analysis is conducted by presenting this app to focus groups and having them select products they are interested in.



Using the BusMall Survey App:
The focus group member clicks one of three randomized product-images on the screen they like the best.
After each click, the market analysis tool regenerates with three new images.
The process is repeated for 15 clicks, and the user is then given the option to view results.
When the user clicks the "View Results" button, a bar chart appears displaying the percentage of clicks on each product based off of total clicks.
The app utilizes local storage to store the market analysis data. If the page is refreshed and another user inputs their information, the new survey information will be added to the bar graph when selecting the "View Results" button.
The app has a button to clear local storage for testing purposes.
