BusMall Project

The purpose of this project is to do market analysis for a fictional company BusMall.
BusMall specializes in items you can purchase while in transit on a metro bus.
The market analysis is to determine which of the 15 BusMall products is a user most likely to purchase.
This is done via user testing with images of the BusMall products.
The user clicks one of three randomized product-images on the screen they like the best.
After each click, the market analysis tool regenerates with 3 new images.
The process is repeated for 15 clicks, and the user is then given the option to view results.
Whether the user chooses to view results is also recorded for marketing purposes.
