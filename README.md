BusMall Project

The purpose of this project is to do market analysis for a fictional company BusMall.
BusMall specializes in items you can purchase while in transit on a metro bus.
The market analysis is to determine which of the 15 BusMall products is a user most likely to purchase.
This is done via focus group testing with images of the BusMall products.
The focus group member clicks one of three randomized product-images on the screen they like the best.
After each click, the market analysis tool regenerates with 3 new images.
The process is repeated for 15 clicks, and the user is then given the option to view results.
When the user clicks the "View Results" button, a bar chart appears displaying the percentage of clicks on each product based off of total clicks.
